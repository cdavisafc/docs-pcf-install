title: Configuring Ops Manager Director for AWS
---

This topic describes how to configure the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations
Manager components that you need to run <a
href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf">Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>
(PCF) on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

***<p class="tip">CAUTION: Pivotal strongly recommends installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry using AWS CloudFormation, as described in [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; on AWS](./cloudform.html), rather than configuring AWS manually as documented here.</p>***

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Ensure that you have successfully completed all steps in the [Manually
Configuring AWS for PCF](./pcf-aws-manual-config.html) topic before beginning
this procedure.

## <a id='pcfaws-om-access'></a>Step 1: Access Ops Manager ##

1. Locate the public DNS address address for Ops Manager on the **Instances**
    page of the AWS EC2 Dashboard.
    Sort the **Instance Type** column to find the **m3.large** instance that you
    created in [Configure the Pivotal Ops Manager
    AMI](./pcf-aws-manual-config.html#pcfaws-om-ami), then note the Public
    DNS for that instance.
    For example:

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/pcf_aws_public_dns.png") %>

1. Use the public DNS address of your Ops Manager instance to launch Ops Manager
    in a browser.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: On your first login attempt, an error
    message that the connection is untrusted appears because you are attempting
    to connect securely to a website with a self-signed certificate.
    Add Ops Manager as an exception to bypass this message on subsequent
    logins.</p>

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. Enter a **Username** and **Admin password**.

1. Enter a **Decryption passphrase**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager's datastore. You must create a passphrase upon each reboot of the Ops Manager VM. Be sure to record this passphrase, because it cannot be recovered.

1. Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept.

1. Click **Create Admin User** to create an Ops Manager administrator account.

1. After the setup process has completed, you will be presented with the Cloud Foundry login page. Enter the Admin username and password you created.

1. Select **S3 Compatible Blobstore** for **Blobstore Location** and complete
    the associated fields:
    * **S3 Endpoint**: Navigate to the [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) topic in the AWS documentation. Locate the endpoint for your region in the **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** table and construct a URL using your region's endpoint. For example, if you are using the us-west-1 region the URL you create would be `https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com`. Enter this URL into the **S3 Endpoint** field in Ops Manager.
    * **Bucket Name**: Enter the Ops Manager bucket name that you defined in 
    the [Create an S3 Bucket](./pcf-aws-manual-config.html#pcfaws-s3) 
    section of the _Manually Configuring PCF for AWS_ topic.
    * **Access Key** and **Secret Key**: Enter your **Access Key ID** and **AWS
    Secret Key** information.
    To retrieve your AWS key information, use the IAM credentials that you
