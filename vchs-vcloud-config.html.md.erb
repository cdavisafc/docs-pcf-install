<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Before following these instructions you must [deploy Ops Manager and configure NAT and Firewall rules](./pcf-vchs-vcloud.html).

Refer to the following procedure for help configuring the Ops Manager Director
for VMware vCloud Air and vCloud product tile.

## <a id='access-ops-man'></a>Step 1: Access Ops Manager

1. Log in to Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) Operations Manager.

1. Click the **Ops Manager Director for VMware vCloud** tile.

## <a id='vcloud-config'></a>Step 2: vCloud Config Page

1. Select **vCloud Config** and enter the following information:
    1. The URL of the vCloud Director.
    1. The **Organization name**.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: vCloud Air and vCloud Director use
    case-sensitive organization names. The name that you supply in the Ops
    Manager <strong>Organization name</strong> field must match the vCD
    organization name exactly.</p>
    1. Your credentials.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This user must have create and delete
    privileges for VMs and folders.</p>
    1. The **Virtual Datacenter name** and **Storage Profile name**.
    The name that you supply in the Ops Manager <strong>Virtual Datacenter
    name</strong> field must be the name of the virtual datacenter as it appears
    in vCloud Director.
    This name is an alphanumeric string with a "VDC" prefix. See the example in
    the image below.
    1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='dir-config'></a>Step 3: Director Config Page

1. Select **Director Config**.
    1. Enter a comma-delimited list of time server addresses.
    1. If you have installed and configured the Ops Metrics product, enter the
    **Metrics IP Address**.
    1. Check or uncheck **Enable VM resurrector plugin**.
    1. Pivotal recommends that you select **Internal** for your **Blobstore
    Location** and **Database Location**.
    1. **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the Ops Manager
		Director can run simultaneously.
		For vCloud, the default value is 4.
		Leave the Max Threads field blank to use this default value.
		Pivotal recommends that you use the default value unless doing so
		results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.
    1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='networks'></a>Step 4: Network Pages

1. Select **Create Networks**.
    Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:

    1. Define a unique name for the network.
    1. Enter the **vCloud Network Name** as it appears in vCloud Director.
    1. Enter a valid CIDR block in **Subnet**.
    1. Enter any IP addresses from the **Subnet** that you want to blacklist
    from the installation in **Excluded IP Ranges**.
    1. Enter the **DNS** and **Gateway** IP addresses.
    1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("vcloud-create-networks.png") %>

1. Select **Assign Networks**.
    You can configure the Ops Manager Director to have an IP address on one
    network.
    Use the drop-down menu to select the network that acts as the infrastructure
    and deployment network for Ops Manager.

## <a id='security-config'></a>Step 5: Security Page

1. Select **Security**.
    Generate VM passwords or use single password for all VMs. Pivotal recommends using the default BOSH password.

    <%= image_tag("vcloud-security.png") %>

## <a id='resource-config'></a>Step 6: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.
1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment, such as increasing the persistent disk size. Select **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to provision the amount of persistent disk predefined by the job. If the persistent disk field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='exper-features'></a>Step 7: (Optional) Experimental Features Page

These are features that you should be cautious about enabling if you have other Pivotal Cloud Foundry service tiles installed in your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment. Not all of the services are guaranteed to work as expected with these features enabled.

1. Select the **Experimental Features** tab.

1. Enter a trusted certificate and click **Save**.

These certificates enable BOSH-deployed VMs to trust a custom root certificate, but adding certificates in this way does not yet insert them into application containers or into your UAA's JVM store, which would be necessary to enable UAA-to-SASL trust. 

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> When the Trusted Certificates functionality is developed to add certificates into containers and the UAA, this feature will be moved out of the Experimental Features section. </p>

## <a id='complete-installation'></a>Step 8: Complete the Ops Manager Director Installation

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
    Dashboard, and click **Apply Changes**.

1. After you complete this procedure, follow the next steps in [Configuring Elastic Runtime for vSphere and vCloud] (http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/config-er-vmware.html).
