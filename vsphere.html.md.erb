<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on vSphere and vCloud Air.
It will walk you through how to deploy the installation virtual machine known as Ops Manager, configure your vSphere settings, and install PCF Elastic Runtime.

If you experience a problem while following the steps below, check the [Known Issues](../pcf-release-notes/index.html), or refer to the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.html).
Once you have completed the steps in this guide, explore the documentation on
[docs.pivotal.io](http://docs.pivotal.io) to learn more about [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF)
and the Pivotal product suite.

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If you are performing an upgrade from PCF 1.5 to 1.6, see <a href="upgrading-pcf.html#pcf16upgrade">Upgrading Ops Manager</a> for critical upgrade information.</p>

## <a id='system'></a>Step 1: Confirm System Requirements ##

Before you begin your PCF deployment, ensure that your system meets the
minimum requirements.
The requirements include capacity for the virtual machines necessary for the
deployment, a supported version of the cf command line interface tool, and
certain user privileges.
Refer to the [Prerequisites to Deploying Operations Manager and Elastic Runtime](./requirements.html) topic for the complete list.

## <a id='deploy'></a>Step 2: Deploy PCF Ops Manager ##

1. Log in to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) and download the Ops
Manager virtual appliance file that matches your infrastructure.

1. Deploy Ops Manager using the procedure that corresponds to the VMware environment that you use:

* [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](./deploying-vm.html)
* [Deploying Operations Manager to vCloud Air and vCloud](./pcf-vchs-vcloud.html)

## <a id='paas'></a>Step 3: Configure and Install PCF ##

**Goal**: Configure and install Ops Manager Director (included), Elastic
Runtime, and MySQL for PCF.
Skip the import steps for Elastic Runtime or MySQL for PCF if you do not
want to import these products.

1. Browse to the interface IP address that you specified in Step 2.

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. When Ops Manager boots for the first time, you must:
    * Enter a **Username** and **Admin password**.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable if forgotten.  
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created on the initial setup page.  

    <%= image_tag("cf-login.png") %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: On your first login attempt, an error
	message that the connection is untrusted appears because you are attempting
	to connect securely to a website with a self-signed certificate. Add Ops
	Manager as an exception to bypass this message on subsequent logins. </p>

### <a id='import-tiles'></a>Import Products ###

### <a id='configure-vmware'></a>Configure Ops Manager Director ###

Your Ops Manager download includes a tile for the version of Ops Manager
Director that corresponds to your IaaS.
Refer to one of the following topics for help configuring your Ops Manager
Director product tile:

* [Configuring Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere](./vsphere-config.html)
* [Configuring Ops Manager Director for vCloud Air and vCloud](./vchs-vcloud-config.html)

### <a id='configure-er'></a>Configure Elastic Runtime ###

See [Configuring Elastic Runtime for vSphere and vCloud Air](./config-er-vmware.html).

### <a id='configure-mysql'></a>Configure MySQL ###

1. Click the **MySQL Dev** tile.

1. Configure the MySQL Service Plan, Lifecycle Errands, and resource sizes.
Assign Availability Zones and an Ops Manager network, then click **Save**.

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
Dashboard.

### <a id='install'></a>Install Products ###

1. Click **Install**.

     <%= image_tag("guide/install.png") %>

1. Your updated PCF installation begins deploying.

     <%= image_tag("guide/deploy-progress.png") %>

1. When the deployment is finished, a success message appears.

     <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: On the recommended hardware
	infrastructure, deployment should take less than one hour and require no
	user intervention.</p>

You now have a fully functional installation of PCF and Pivotal MySQL
Service.

## <a id='new-users'></a>Step 4: Create New User Accounts ##

Once you have successfully deployed PCF, add users to your account.
Refer to the [Creating New Elastic Runtime User Accounts](./creating-account.html) topic for more information.

## <a id='target'></a>Step 5: Target Elastic Runtime ##

The next step is to use the cf CLI tool to target your Elastic Runtime
installation.
Make sure that you have [installed the cf CLI tool](../devguide/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).
Refer to the PCF documentation for more information about [using the cf
command line tool](../devguide/cf-cli/getting-started.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In Pivotal Ops Manager, refer to
	<strong>Elastic Runtime > Credentials</strong> for the UAA admin name and
	password. You can also use the user that you created in Apps Manager, or
	create another user with the <code>create-user</code> command.</p>
